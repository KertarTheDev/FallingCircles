FallingCircles is a primitive cross-platform game developed primarily for fun and practice. The idea is borrowed from a job interview test task given to one of my friends.

=======================================
GAMEPLAY:

The goal of a player is to increase his score. This is done by destroying circles falling from the top border of a rectangle playing field. To destroy a circle a user has to click it. Circles appear along the whole top border of the playing field with a condition that they fit into the screen completely. When a circle reaches the bottom border of the playing field it disappears without giving any points. Circles have different size which determines their falling speed and the amount of points obtained by destroying them (smaller size means more points). The falling speed stays constant during the fall. The game does not have an end in the current concept.

=======================================
TOOLS:

The FallingCircles is developed using Qt and OpenGL libraries.
